before the 20 billion debt issuance, opat was 10. 66 billion and investors got 8. 665 billion. after the 20 billion debt issuance, opat goes up 10. 828 billion. but the after - tax income that goes to investors, goes down to 8. 537 billion in this case. so, opat increases, but the after - tax payoff decreases when we issue debt. the government, they are really the key player here. the government, okay?

so, remember our opat picture, we have leverage on the x - axis, profits on the y - axis, and we have our opat. and opat goes up as we level up. that's the corporate tax effect. what happens with personal taxes, is that this benefit becomes smaller? so, profits do not increase as much with leverage as we would have thought, okay? but if you look at the picture, what it shows is that there's still a positive slope. so what john graham shows, is that even after taking personal taxes into account, companies are on net taking money away from the government when they increase leverage. and companies give it to debt holders and shareholders.\\n\\nMaterial Metadata:\\nSource: /Users/ryanlindbeck/Development/resai/app/backend/notebooks/documents/mod_5_transcript.pdf\\nPage: 79\\n\", \"\\nMaterial Content:\\ncorporate finance ii : financing investments and managing risk professors heitor almeida and stefan zeume 82 let's next think about a very extreme example here. so far, after - tax profits increase as you take on more debt. why not increase debt even further?
