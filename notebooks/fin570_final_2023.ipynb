it's wrong because this is speculation, it's not hedging. companies should try to produce value from the products that they make. so, if you're using steel as an input, what you want to do is you want to sell your product at a high price, you want to make a good product. you should not be betting on the steel market. if the company's cfo wants to do that, my proposal is that the cfo should move to wall street. that's the picture here, if you want to take risk move to an investment bank. that's where you can trade, try to make profits out of things like steel futures. a company is not the right place to do that. what are the good reasons to hedge? there are three reasons we're going to talk about here. the first one is to be able to choose which risks the company wants to take, the second one is eliminating risks outside of the company's control, which is related but a little bit different. the third one is to reduce the risk of financial distress. these are all valid reasons that corporate finance theory has proposed, and that make sense both in theory and in practice.\\n\\nMaterial Metadata:\\nSource: /Users/ryanlindbeck/Development/resai/app/backend/notebooks/documents/fin570/module7.pdf\\nPage: 9\\n\", \"\\nMaterial Content:\\ncorporate finance [UNK] : financing investments and managing risk professor heitor almeida and stefan zeume 13 remember that, choosing risks. a company may also want to eliminate risks that are outside of the company's control. let me give you an example. suppose we have an airline. the airline profits are going to be sensitive to oil prices. what the airline cfo is proposing is that they should engage in a hedging strategy because they would like their profits to better reflect the number of tickets that the airline sells, how much the customers like the airline, they don't want the profits to reflect variation in oil prices. it's a risk outside of the company's control that can be very valuable for example, for executive compensation. we know that the cfos even, are paid depending on bonuses and stock, so ceo compensation is going to go up if the company is doing well, but if an airline is doing well because the oil price went down, maybe we shouldn't pay more to the cfo. the cfo should just make money if the airline sells more tickets, but the cfo compensation should not really be tied to oil prices. again, using the futures market or another hedging tool may be a way to eliminate this particular risk. you still have risk because you are exposed to the tickets, so your profits are going to depend on how many tickets you sell, but they are no longer going to depend on oil prices. good reason to hedge.\\n\\nMaterial Metadata:\\nSource: /Users/ryanlindbeck/Development/resai/app/backend/notebooks/documents/fin570/module7.pdf\\nPage: 12\\n\", \"\\nMaterial Content:\\ncorporate finance [UNK] : financing investments and managing risk professor heitor almeida and stefan zeume 70 lesson 1 - 7 : operational hedging lesson 1 - 7. 1. operational hedging let's talk now about operational hedging, which is another option that companies have to manage risks when futures may not be available. the idea is that companies can hedge risks by changing their operations. let me give you a specific example of a japanese company, honda. it makes cars. and about 50 % of its car sales happen in the us.\\n\\nMaterial Metadata:\\nSource: /Users/ryanlindbeck/Development/resai/app/backend/notebooks/documents/fin570/module7.pdf\\nPage: 69\\n\", \"\\nMaterial Content:\\ncorporate finance [UNK] : financing investments and managing risk professor heitor almeida and stefan zeume 110 lesson 1 - 10 : review and graded activities lesson 1 - 10. 1. module 3 review this module was about risk management. and we started by identifying right and wrong reasons for hedging risks. so, remember, hedging is not about reducing risk. hedging is about choosing which risks to take. that's the key idea we talked about in this module. we also talked about how companies can use forwards and futures to hedge specific risks that they want to eliminate. we talked about specific positions that companies have to take, which direction. and in particular, we emphasized that it's very important to distinguish hedging from speculation. speculation is the wrong way to go to a futures market. it's the wrong reason to go to a futures market.\\n\\nMaterial Metadata:\\nSource: /Users/ryanlindbeck/Development/resai/app/backend/notebooks/documents/fin570/module7.pdf\\nPage: 109\\n\"]\n"

      "A) The Japanese manufacturer should consider hedging its currency risk by using futures or forwards contracts. These contracts would allow the company to lock in a specific exchange rate for the conversion of its Dollar revenues into Yen, thus protecting it from potential unfavorable movements in the exchange rate. This strategy would help the company to eliminate risks outside of its control and focus on its core business operations.\n",

      "B) The US company should consider using a forward contract to hedge its currency risk. This contract would allow the company to lock in today's exchange rate for its future payment in Brazilian Reais, thus protecting it from potential unfavorable movements in the exchange rate. This strategy would help the company to eliminate risks outside of its control and focus on its core business operations.\n",
      "\n",
      "C) The CFO's belief that oil prices are going to increase is a speculative position, not a hedging strategy. As a multinational company with no significant operational exposure to oil, it should not be betting on the oil market. If the CFO wants to speculate on oil prices, he should do so in a personal capacity or move to an investment bank. The company should focus on creating value from its core business operations.\n",
      "\n",
      "D) The CFO of the start-up company could consider using interest rate swaps to hedge against the risk of rising interest rates. This would involve swapping its variable interest rate for a fixed rate, thus locking in its cost of equity for the next year. This strategy would help the company to eliminate risks outside of its control and focus on its core business operations.\n"
