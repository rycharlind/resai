look at pepsi's balance sheet right here and right in this moment. but remember for leverage we use the market value of equity. so be extra careful if you use standard data sources like morningstar, they might report a lot of data for you and before you know it you're using lever leverage based on book values. so, you know you might be lazy and just google leverage for your company of interest and you might even find a neat little pie chart like this one. pie charts help us think of the company as a pie and then we can figure out who's eating that pie here, debt holders and equity holders

chart is 16 million and the debt value is 34 million. okay. but when you look at it a little bit closer, when you look at the small print you might realize that these are book values. the book value of equity is a poor proxy for the value of equity because it ignores everything that happens in the future. so, hands off the pie chart most of the value of equity for a healthy company like pepsi is
