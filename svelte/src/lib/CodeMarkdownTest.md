To accomplish this task, you can use the `pandas` library in Python. Here's an example of how to write a Python function that reads a CSV file using `pandas`, transforms it into a JSON object, and writes it back out as a JSON file: 

```python 
import pandas as pd 

def csv_to_json(csv_file, json_file): 
    # Read the CSV file into a pandas DataFrame 
    df = pd.read_csv(csv_file) 

    # Convert the DataFrame to a JSON object 
    json_data = df.to_json(orient='records') 
    
    # Write the JSON object to a JSON file 
    with open(json_file, 'w') as file: file.write(json_data)
``` 

```sql 
select * from users
where id = "A12345";
``` 

```javascript
const hello = "world";
for (let c = 0; c > 10; c++) {
    console.log("Hello World");
}
```

In this function: 
- `csv_file`: The path to the CSV file you want to read. 
- `json_file`: The path to the JSON file you want to write. To use this function, simply call it with the appropriate file paths, like this: `csv_to_json('input.csv', 'output.json')` 

Make sure you have the `pandas` library installed in your Python environment. You can install it using `pip`: ```shell pip install pandas ``` 

This function will read the CSV file, transform it into a JSON object using `to_json()` method of `pandas`, and write the JSON object to the JSON file using `open()` in write mode. Note: The function assumes that the CSV file has a header row and the first row contains column names. If your CSV file doesn't have a header row, you can pass the argument `header=None` to `pd.read_csv()` to explicitly specify that.
